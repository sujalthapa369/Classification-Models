Cat vs Dog Classifier
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs. Implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, this project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to solve binary image classification tasks.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this notebook is to classify input images as either a cat or a dog using a CNN model trained on a labeled dataset of pet images. The workflow includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Building a CNN from scratch

Training and evaluating the model

Visualizing predictions

🧠 Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of:

3 Convolutional Layers (with ReLU and MaxPooling)

Flatten layer

Fully Connected Dense Layer

Output layer with sigmoid activation (binary classification)

📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of two folders:

bash

Edit
/cats
/dogs
Each containing images of cats and dogs respectively.

📎 Note: You should organize your dataset into train, validation, and test directories under a data folder like so:

bash
Copy
Edit
data/
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
├── validation/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
└── test/
    ├── cats/
    └── dogs/
